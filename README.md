# smokes
Automated smoke tests for jbossas.

If you're working on this project and want to build it just run 

mvn package.

If you want to run this project then wget run.sh from my s01 and:

./run.sh

run.sh ssh's into towercn as the smoketests user gets the lastest 
smoke-remote.sh script and runs it.
